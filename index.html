<p>We are andy and ashley, creative technologists based in Oakland, CA.</p>

<p>8 years ago we created We Less Than three as a design and development studio focused for the most part on enabling startups and small businesses to get their ideas out into the world. </p>

<p>Along the way, we've done some extracurricular projects that we're really proud of and one of us went back to school to become a master of design.</p>

<p>Currently we both work for awesome companies doing forward thinking work in the fields of science and journalism.</p>

<p>We are not currently accepting commissions for work, but are always interested in discussing radical ideas and potential side projects. If you'd like to drop us a line please do!</p>
